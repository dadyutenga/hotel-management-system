- **res** - Reservations, guests, group bookings
- **fin** - Folios, payments, invoices, accounting
- **pos** - Point of sale, menus, orders
- **ops** - Operations (housekeeping, maintenance)
- **inv** - Inventory management

All models reference tables with schema prefixes (e.g., `res.guests`, `fin.folios`).
