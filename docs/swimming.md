PROPOSED DASBOARD ALTERATIONS. 
1. Add profile icon icon the far right corner of the logged in user, should be visible every 
where. 
2. On the name column instead of actual names should either be adult or children. 
3. Add a method of payment column after status to specify the method that ere used to settle 
the various payments. 
4. Add a summary tab which shows total amount from each ,payment method of the particular 
day. 
5. Add a button at the end of swimming and playground tables to increase number of 
customers 
6. Therefore when the user clicks add button,the sticker number is filled manually, while the 
user selects if the customer is either adult of child , the amount column is auto filled based 
on selection if the customer is either adult or child. 
7. Discount amount  can only be set by the manager of supervisor. 
8. Add a setting called discount settings which has two options “ALL DICOUNTs” OR 
“CUSTOM DISCOUNT” by default its is custom discount, where manager can give 
discount to few customers - the discount amount is set there within the discount setting, but 
when the discount  setting is at “all discounts” within the dicount settings the user writes 
the discount amount that would automatically apply to all. 
9. Within the discount settings add category selection of either adult or chil.dren,to easily 
set to whom the user wants the discount applied to. 
10.  ADD A TABLE to track sales of swimming products such as hair cap, swimming googles. 
The table should be same format as that of swimming and playground, but instead of 
sticker number column replace it with PRODUCT COLUMN where each row would hae a 
dropdown selection(selection is automated from a list on the settings section)  to select the sold 
product.  
11. ADD A “SUBMIT BUTTON” for all swimming table, playground table and swimming 
products table. Once it is submitted it means the statement is ready for review by the 
supervisor and accountant therefore the add button cannot be used and other features that 
apply change on the daily statement.
