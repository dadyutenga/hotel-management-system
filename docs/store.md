REQUISITION. 
All departments from the hotel submit their request through requisition for approval by supervisor 
and the request is automatically sent to the store to check for availability and delivery. 
If the required items are available on the store the STORE KEEPER responds to the requisition 
through DELIVERY NOTE. 
If the product is not available then the store keeper can reply to the department through delivery 
note of item absence. Then the store keeper can make requisition for low stock items to the 
procurement department , where they will have to make a local purchase order to their suppliers. 
DELIVERY NOTE: 
Is a manual edited document that lists all the item that have been delivered from the store , its a 
proof to item arrival. 
THE PROPOSED DESIGN FOR DELIVERY NOTE. 
1. Delivery note just like requisition goes in sequential numbering. 
2. Each department should have its own delivery note page, e.g. cannot mix kitchen delivery 
and house keeping deliveries. 
3. On top of the table can put space for suppliers info such as business name and phone 
number. 
4. This document should be printable 
5. The numbering id should not repeat over the span of the same year. 
6. Should indicate to what requisition number or id is it replying t
