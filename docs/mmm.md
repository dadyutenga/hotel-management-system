Chart rendering is bound to `alpine:init`, but the layout defers Alpine and Chart.js in sequence. When Alpine fires `alpine:init` (before the deferred Chart.js script executes), this handler calls `new Chart(...)` while `window.Chart` is still undefined, raising a runtime error and leaving all dashboard charts blank. Delay the initialization until Chart.js is available (e.g., wait for `DOMContentLoaded` and check `window.Chart` or run after the Chart.js script tag).
